## Talks

|[![logo](/images/lab-meeting-logo.png)](/assets/SKA_labmeeting_7_18_16.pdf)|*Simulating mTOR hyperactivating mutations to understand functionally significant structural rearrangements* <br> <br> Talk I gave for ChoderaLab lab meeting, where I covered traditional MD analysis of mTOR mutants, first attempts at building an MSM for WT mTOR as well as an early attempt to improve loop modeling using alchemical softening with SAMS.|
|[![logo](/images/lab-meeting-logo.png)](/assets/embo_workshop.pdf)|*Using physical modeling to direct biophysical experiments and predict the functional impact of clinical cancer mutations in kinases on drug susceptibility* <br> <br> A talk I gave at the EMBO workshop on integreating genomics and biophysics in Turin, Italy in 2017. It focuses on the use of protein mutation FEP to predict resistance mutants in Abl kinase, and plans for prospective work on predicting and then measuring the calculations in Src|
|[![logo](/images/lab-meeting-logo.png)](/assets/SKA_MIG_101417.pdf)|*Using physical modeling to direct biophysical experiments and predict the functional impact of clinical cancer mutations in kinases on drug susceptibility* <br> <br> A talk I gave at the [Med Into Grad conference at Columbia on Precision Medicine](https://columbiamedintograd2017.wordpress.com/) in 2017. It focuses on the use of protein mutation FEP to predict resistance mutants in Abl kinase, and plans for prospective work on predicting and then measuring the calculations in Src|
|[![logo](/images/lab-meeting-logo.png)](/assets/GSS_121417.pdf)|*Is structure based drug design ready to predict selectivity* <br> <br> A talk I gave for my yearly Graduate Student Seminar in 2017. In it, I look at the accuracy of relative and absolute free energy calculations for predicting the selectivity between two targets, as well as a brief look at using protein mutation FEP to close the thermodynamic cycle between two targets|
