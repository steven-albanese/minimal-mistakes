My name is Steven Albanese. Currently, I am in my 4th year as a a PhD student
at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.sloankettering.edu/gerstner)
and work in [John Chodera's Lab](https://www.choderalab.org)

## Interests
My research interests are focused on using computational chemistry and automated biophysical experiments to design better cancer therapeutics. Specifically,
I'm interested in how clinically observed mutations alter protein structure and understanding how these alterations inform patient response to existing therapies or can be leveraged to design more selective inhibitors. 
I am also interested in automating wetlabs to streamline high throughput molecular biology and biophysical protocols.
