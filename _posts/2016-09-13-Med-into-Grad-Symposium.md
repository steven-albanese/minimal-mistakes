<br />

The GSK Experimental Therapeutics Symposium at GSK will take place at the end 
of this month, the result of efforts by my fellow co-organizer Michelle Riegman and myself, 
as well as the administrative staff at GSK. We've organized this conference with the goal of bringing 
PhD and MD-PhD students together from former 
[Med into Grad grant](http://www.hhmi.org/programs/med-into-grad-initiative)
recipient institutions clustered in the Northeast. This grant was designed to close the gap between the clinic and biomedical science by funding
the creation of translational degree or enrichment programs. This symposium will bring together 
this cohort of students for PI talks, 
a poster session, 10 minute student talks and [student lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk).
<br />
<br />
Students will also get to take place in mock grand rounds, hosted by [Dr. Aimee Crago](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/aimee-crago) from Memorial Hospital
and two medical fellows.
[Dr. Gary Schwartz](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/hematology-oncology/about_us/gary_schwartz)
will give a talk about moving cancer therapeutics from bench to bedside and how cancer therapy has changed over time, 
[Dr. Charles Rudin](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/charles-rudin) will 
talk about emerging therapies for small cell
lung cancer, [Dr. David Solit](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/david-solit) 
plans to speak about determining actionable 
drug targets and [Dr. Hazel Szeto](http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-hhszeto) will talk 
about her work developing peptides 
to treat mitochondrial disease.
